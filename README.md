My macOS setup and configuration using:

-   [Nix](https://nixos.org)
-   [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin)
-   [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)

# Steps on a new machine

## First steps

1. Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal.app
    - this is needed for some nix flake rebuild steps
1. Call `setup_mac.sh` gist
    ```zsh
    zsh <(curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dskwrite/54c44145968b0fdf2501838e3a912ebf/raw/96e0e71b75e7c6e6f8153cbf74e78c484a8bf2c0/setup_mac.sh) "<replace-with-machine-name>"
    ```
    - renames machine
    - installs Homebrew (since nix-darwin doesn't support installing Homebrew)

## Nix

1. install Nix (using Determinate Systems installer)
    ```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
    ```
    - Provides a better installation experience compared to the official Nix installer. See [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer)
1. Clone this repo with nix shell, as Git isn't installed yet

    ```

    ```

1. Build ...

    ```

    ```

1. Restart machine, as certain changes require it
