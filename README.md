# dotfiles

This repo contains my macOS setup and configuration using:

-   [Nix](https://nixos.org)
-   [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin)
-   [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)

# Structure

-   `flake.nix`: Defines inputs (Nixpkgs, nix-darwin, home-manager) and the main `darwinConfigurations` entry point. **Note:** The username (`dsk`) is currently hardcoded here.
-   `darwin.nix`: Configures system-level settings using `nix-darwin`, including:
    -   macOS system defaults (Dock, Finder, Trackpad, etc.)
    -   Homebrew integration (manages formulae, casks, and MAS apps)
    -   Installed fonts
    -   Touch ID for sudo
    -   Integration with Home Manager
-   `chezmoi/` directory: Dotfiles managed by `chezmoi`.

# Steps on a new machine

## First steps

1. Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal.app
    - System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access > add /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
    - this is needed for some nix flake rebuild steps

1. Call `setup_mac.sh` gist
    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dskwrite/54c44145968b0fdf2501838e3a912ebf/raw/96e0e71b75e7c6e6f8153cbf74e78c484a8bf2c0/setup_mac.sh) "<replace-with-machine-name>"
    ```
    - renames machine
    - installs Homebrew (since nix-darwin doesn't support installing Homebrew)

## Nix

1. Install Nix (using Determinate Systems installer)
    ```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
    ```
    - Provides a better installation experience compared to the official Nix installer. See [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer)

1. Clone this repo with nix shell, as Git isn't installed yet

    ```bash
    # Ensure Nix is available in your shell first (e.g., close and reopen terminal after install)
    nix shell nixpkgs#git --command git clone <your-repo-url> ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ```

    - Installs `git` using Nix, so that you can clone the rest of your dotfiles

1. Build and apply the configuration:

    ```bash
    # Apply the configuration (builds and activates)
    darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#default
    ```
    - This command installs all configured packages (Nix, Homebrew, Casks, MAS apps) and applies system/user settings.

1. Restart machine, as certain changes require it
